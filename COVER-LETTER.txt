Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a full-stack engineer with 9+ years shipping production systems in payments, trading, healthcare, and infrastructure. I specialize in building reliable, event-driven architectures using .NET, SignalR, and React—systems that process critical data at scale with zero downtime.

### What I Bring

**Real-time Systems Expert** — I've architected and shipped production dashboards handling real-time patient monitoring, stock market data, and payment flows. I understand WebSocket patterns, automatic reconnection, and broadcast architectures at a deep level. My Signalsboard project (live on Azure) demonstrates this: a hospital monitoring system built with ASP.NET Core 8, React + TypeScript, and SignalR that handles 24/7 critical alerts.

**Production-Grade Code** — Not just functional, but maintainable. I refactored legacy PHP codebases into object-oriented PHP 8, reducing onboarding time and improving reliability. I use xUnit, Testcontainers, and integration testing as standard practice. I understand database indexing strategies, query optimization, and migrations at scale.

**Full-Stack Depth** — I don't just write backend. I ship polished UX with React, Material-UI, and Zustand. I deploy to Azure Container Apps with zero-downtime updates. I automate CI/CD with GitHub Actions. I containerize with Docker. I'm comfortable across the entire stack because I've built entire products end-to-end.

**9 Years of Context** — From ePayments portals (ASP.NET Web Forms) to IoT manufacturing systems to modern SPA dashboards, I've learned what works and what doesn't. I understand legacy modernization, greenfield architecture, and everything in between.

### What I'm Looking For

Roles where I can ship real features to real users. I'm most interested in:
- Real-time systems (WebSocket, event streams, SignalR)
- Backend architecture (.NET, Node.js, cloud infrastructure)
- Full-stack projects where code quality matters
- Teams that ship reliable systems, not just fast ones

I've spent 9 years learning what works at production scale. I want to apply that.

### Availability

**🌍 Available for Remote Work** — I'm open to remote positions worldwide and have extensive experience working with distributed teams.

### Let's Talk

I'd love to discuss how my experience can contribute to your team. Check out my portfolio at **https://zrrtcs.github.io/portfolio** and my featured project, Signalsboard, which showcases production-grade full-stack development.

Looking forward to connecting.

**Best regards,**

**Aizzat Suhardi**
